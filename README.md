# ROOT

[ROOT](https://root.cern) is a C++ framework developed by CERN to be used in the analysis of high energy particle physics experiments. These are a series of little programs I'm writing to familiarize myself with its features.

## RUNNING THE PROGRAMS

### MACROS

From the command line:
'''
root FILENAME.C
'''
From the interactive shell:
'''
root [0] .x FILENAME.C
'''

## OVERVIEW

[ex1](./ex1): ROOT macro to draw a 1 parameter function f(x)
[ex2](./ex2): ROOT macro to draw a 2 parameter function f(x,y)
